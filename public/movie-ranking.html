<h2>My Favorite Movies of all-time</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>1. The Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>It is a strange comment to make about a film set inside a prison, but "The Shawshank Redemption" creates a warm hold on our feelings because it makes us a member of a family.</p>
<h3>2. Scarface</h3>
<p>Brian De Palma's "Scarface" rises or falls with Al Pacino's performance, which is aggressive, over the top, teeth-gnashing, arm-waving, cocaine-snorting, scenery chewing -- and brilliant, some say, while others find it unforgivably flamboyant. What were Pacino's detractors hoping for?</p>
<h3>3. Batman: The Dark Knight Rises</h3>
<p>"The Dark Knight Rises" leaves the fanciful early days of the superhero genre far behind, and moves into a doom-shrouded, apocalyptic future that seems uncomfortably close to today's headlines.</p>
